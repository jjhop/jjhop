I'm developer. 

I use mostly Java and Python. And also othere languages like Clojure, Common Lisp, Racket,Ruby, Rust, Go, Erlang, Elixir. Unfortunatelly most of them are addons for my toolbox or just something I like and use in my spare time (a few of them were abandoned many years ago - like Ruby, I like theme but for for now I have na chance to use).
